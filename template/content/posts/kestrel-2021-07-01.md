*Let's setup our monitoring stack and do a
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) hunting
practice to reason from Scheduled Windows Tasks for discovering persistent
Windows threats.*

### Kestrel Installation

We follow the [Kestrel Installation
Guideline](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and
install Kestrel in a Python virtual environment on a Linux hunting box with
Python 3.9.

We first create a clean Python virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
$ python -m venv huntingspace
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
```

We then install Kestrel runtime with its Jupyter notebook kernel:
```bash
$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install kestrel-jupyter
$ python -m kestrel_jupyter_kernel.setup
```

This step will install all Kestrel runtime and its dependencies such as
[STIX-shifter](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter) as
well as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to use the Kestrel kernel.

### Data Source Setup

We monitor Windows hosts with
[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and
use
[winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html)
to stream events into [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for log
management. Logs in Elasticsearch are
[records](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#record), on
top of which Kestrel provides an abstraction to do [entity-based
reasoning](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity-based-reasoning)
and enables dynamic
[huntflow](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow)
development and sharing.

Kestrel connects to data sources with an extensible set of
[interfaces](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#data-and-analytics-interfaces).
The major one we will use today is its [STIX-shifter
interface](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kestrel_datasource_stixshifter.interface.html).
STIX-shifter enables data retrieval from various data sources, including data
in [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/ecs) (used by
winlogbeat by default) stored at an Elasticsearch server. In the previous
Kestrel installation step, STIX-shifter framework is installed but not
including dozens of its
[connectors](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/blob/develop/OVERVIEW.md#available-connectors).
The user needs to choose which connector to install based on their available
data sources. Let's install the connector for our Sysmon-Elasticsearch(ECS)
data pipeline:

```bash
$ pip install stix-shifter-modules-elastic_ecs
```

We may have many Windows hosts monitored with logs stored in the Elasticsearch
service. Usually, people assign different Elasticsearch indexes for logs from
different monitored hosts to query them individually. One Kestrel data source
configuration specifies one or more monitored Windows host(s), identified by
Elasticsearch indexes, to be associated with the defined Kestrel data source.
The configuration also tells Kestrel how to access the Elasticsearch service
with hostname and credentials like API keys.

We open a new terminal, activate the Python virtual environment with Kestrel,
and export three environment variables to setup a Kestrel data source named
`host101` (more information can be found at [Kestrel
tutorial](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#kestrel-jupyter):

```bash
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTOR=elastic_ecs
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTION='{"host":"elastic.securitylog.company.com", "port":9200, "indices":"host101"}'
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONFIG='{"auth":{"id":"VuaCfGcBCdbkQm-e5aOx", "api_key":"ui2lp2axTNmsyakw9tvNnw"}}'
```

### Start Jupyter And Create A New Huntbook

Next just start Jupyter notebook in the above terminal with our Kestrel data
source configuration (exported environment variables):

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

On the Jupyter page in a browser, we create an empty Kestrel huntbook by choosing
the *Kestrel* kernel under the dropdown menu of *New Notebooks*.

![Kestrel Jupyter New Huntbook](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_new_huntbook.jpg)

A [Kestrel
huntbook](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#hunt-book) is
a Jupyter notebook that contains hunting steps (in
[Kestrel](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html)), the
execution results, and instructions or thoughts (in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). In each notebook cell, we can put
any number of consecutive Kestrel statements/commands, which forms a Kestrel
code block to be executed together. After executing each cell, Kestrel runtime
will give a summary of new variables created in that cell and statistics on
associated logs/records retrieved and cached by the runtime. Notebook cells can
be re-executed or executed out of order in notebook. Jupyter will give an
execution ID left to the cell to indicate the execution order of cells. Note
that if one or more Kestrel variables in a cell depend on the execution of
another cell, the dependent cell or code block needs to be executed first, or
Kestrel will give an error that the variable does not exist in the current
session.

### Getting The List of Windows Schedulers

In this hunt, we will start drilling down from the list of Windows scheduled
tasks/services to hunt persistent threats like
[FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046/). In recent Windows (>= Windows
10 version 1511), scheduled tasks are executed and managed by `svchost.exe`
with a specific argument `-k netsvcs -p -s Schedule`. Tasks are spawned from
the `svchost.exe` processes as child processes at scheduled time. This
understanding written by [Nasreddine
Bencherchali](https://nasbench.medium.com/) in his
[blog](https://nasbench.medium.com/a-deep-dive-into-windows-scheduled-tasks-and-the-processes-running-them-218d1eed4cce)
provides us an idea to view Windows scheduled tasks as process entities, which
can be found by their parent `svchost.exe` processes.

In Kestrel, we use the `GET` command to retrieve data from a data source
directly that matches a given pattern. In this hunt, we are using [STIX
pattern](http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/stix-v2.0-part5-stix-patterning.html)
since the data source interface we are using is STIX-shifter, which translates
STIX pattern into the native query language and translates the results back to
STIX bundles for Kestrel to process.

There are two special items to take care of when writing a STIX pattern in
Kestrel (more detailed in the [GET command
documentation](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#get)):

1. The returned entity type in the `GET` command should always match the
   root-level [STIX Cyber-observable Objects
   (SCO)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html#_Toc16070567)
   type in the STIX pattern.

2. We need to give a time range with `START ... STOP ...` for our first
   pattern. Otherwise, STIX-shifter will default the search for the last five
   minutes, which may not be the time range of interest.

To get the scheduler `svchost.exe`, the straightforward idea to get such
process entities is to match processes with its specific command line using the
following STIX pattern:

```bash
[process:command_line = 'C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule']
```

And we can put the `GET` command in the first huntbook cell to execute:

```elixir
# create Kestrel variable sp with the list of scheduler processes
scheduler = GET process FROM stixshifter://winlaptop141
            WHERE [process:command_line = 'C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule']
            START t'2021-04-03T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2021-04-04T00:00:00Z'
```

When executing the single-command code block, we get an error message
*STIX-shifter translation failed*. We can run this simple STIX pattern via
STIX-shifter directly, and it is very unfortunate a
[bug](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/issues/641) in
the STIX-shifter Elasticsearch connector.

To bypass the bug, we can write an even simpler pattern to match all
`svchost.exe` processes and do a secondary pattern matching on the command
line. Kestrel will run the first pattern via STIX-shifter and the second one
locally against the return of the first `GET`. We put the two `GET` command in
one code block since they will always run together.

```elixir
# first GET going through STIX shifter
svchost = GET process FROM stixshifter://winlaptop141
          WHERE [process:name = 'svchost.exe']
          START t'2021-04-03T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2021-04-04T00:00:00Z'
     
# second GET running locally against the returned/cached data from the first command
# no need to specify time range for GET from a Kestrel variable, check doc for more info
scheduler = GET process
            FROM svchost
            WHERE [process:command_line = 'C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule']
```

### Find Scheduled Tasks

Executing the above cell, we get 183 `svchost.exe` processes in variable
`svchost`.  Only two of them are scheduler processes captured in variable
`scheduler`.

![Kestrel first block execution results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_svchost_summary.png)

The next step is straightforward: finding the child processes of `scheduler`,
which are the scheduled task processes we are interested.

For relationship resolution, we use Kestrel command `FIND`, which will take
care of record-to-entity processing and prefetch related records for further
drilling down.

To use `FIND`, we look up [the command
syntax](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find) for the
appropriate relational syntax to use. The documentation also has some examples
such as finding child processes of processes in a Kestrel variable, which is
exactly what we need here.

```elixir
tasks = FIND process CREATED BY scheduler
DISP tasks ATTR name, command_line
```

In the codeblock above, variable `tasks` contains the child processes from
`scheduler`, and we use a display command `DISP` to show the key attributes of
the process entities in `tasks`. For people who are not familiar with process
entities, they can use `INFO tasks` command to print out all attributes and
then `DISP` some of them.

![Kestrel second block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_tasks_summary.png)

The cell takes 8 seconds to run and find 126 task processes as child processes
of the svchost schedulers in `scheduler`. As part of the long list of `tasks`
displayed, we see some unknown processes `amcet.exe` that we cannot find
information on the Internet:

![Kestrel second block execution results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_tasks_results.png)

### Drilling Down A Scheduled Task

We guess the `amcet.exe` is a legitimate IBM process given its command line
that reveals the path of the executable. We can filter these processes from the
scheduled tasks to further drill down. We will do it with a `GET` command to
create variable `amcet`.

Regarding `amcet`, we can find executable files associated with the processes
using the `FIND` command but it may not give more information than what we
already get from the *command line*. We can also find their child processes to
see if there are any suspicious *powershell* or known malicious processes. In
addition, we can find their associated network traffic if exists to reveal
communications through the network.

Let's write all amcet-related drilling down as a code block into a notebook
cell to execute:

```elixir
# get only the amcet processes from the scheduled tasks
amcet = GET process FROM tasks WHERE [process:name = 'amcet.exe']

# find and display their child processes
amcet_child = FIND process CREATED BY amcet
DISP amcet_child ATTR name, command_line

# find and display their network traffic
nt = FIND network-traffic CREATED BY amcet
DISP nt ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel third block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_amcet_summary.png)

From the execution summary, we get 24 amcet processes, which spawn 45 processes
and establish 23 network traffic.

![Kestrel third block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_amcet_activity_summary.png)

All network traffic share the same remote IP `9.148.5.93` (shown according to
our `DISP nt` command with attributes `dst_ref.value` and `dst_port`):

![Kestrel amcet network traffic disp](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_disp_amcet_nt.png)

From our threat intelligence, we don't see any sign of compromise of the host.
We may check the service on `9.148.5.93:443` to confirm this service is not
compromised. But what's more interesting at this moment is the child processes
we found: the 45 spawned processes fall into only two categories -- `conhost`
and `powershell` as our `DISP` command shows:

![Kestrel amcet child disp](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_disp_amcet_child.png)

The sensitive process here is the `conhost.exe` with parameters `0xffffffff
-ForceV1`, which can access kernel space and is used in many attacks,
especially DLL injection ones. We need to check the child processes and files
used by all processes in `amcet_child` to get an idea whether something is
tampered or there are processes with suspicious command line created.

```elixir
# find child processes of amcet_child
amcet_cc = FIND process CREATED BY amcet_child
DISP amcet_cc ATTR name, command_line

# find files read/written/executed by amcet_child
# Kestrel v1.0.8 only resolves the generic relation LINKED into STIX 2.0 references,
# which is limited to execution relation between processes and executables
amcet_f = FIND file LINKED amcet_child
DISP amcet_f ATTR name, parent_directory_ref.path
```

After executing this cell, we see no child processes created by any process in
`amcet_child` (zero entity in `amcet_cc`).

![Kestrel fourth block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_amcet_ccf_summary.png)

There are only two files touched by the processes in `amcet_child` shown from
the `DISP amcet_cc` command, which are just the main executables of the
processes.

### Summary And Stretch Hunts

In the hunting practice, we start from all scheduled Windows tasks and drill
down one specific process but don't find traces of threats so far. Although we
miss the existing moment of finding a persistent threat in the practice, we
create a huntbook that can be reused and revised for future hunts starting from
scheduled Windows tasks. Checking the persistence of threats is usually one of
the beginning phases of discovering large APT campaigns, and the [composable
huntflow](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow)
enables reusing this huntbook and adding different further hunting steps in
different hunts. We only use `GET` and `FIND` commands in this hunting
practice, which covers one of the two categories for hunting step knowledge
codification---pattern matching. In large hunts, another
category---analytics---will be extremely useful, and we will have dedicated
blogs about it.
