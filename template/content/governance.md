# Project Governing Board & Technical Leadership

Governance for the Open Cybersecurity Alliance is managed by its [Project Governing Board](#pgb) and
its [Technical Steering Committee](#tsc). These two groups ensure that all OCA
stakeholders have a voice in decisions affecting the work and that the
contributions of developers, corporate supporters, and technology
consumers are all valued.
