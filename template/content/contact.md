Everyone is welcome to join the Open Cybersecurity Alliance.

The OCA community is committed to providing an open and welcoming environment for contributors. Anyone can join our Slack discussions, subscribe to our mailing lists, and contribute to any of our projects at any time! Please read our Code of Conduct and start participating.

* [Introduce yourself on the OCA #introductions Slack channel](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vEAqg9SKBF3UMtmbJJ9qqLarrXN5zeVG3_obedA3DKs/viewform?edit_requested=true)
* [Subscribe to OCA mailing lists](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca)
* [Follow us on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/OASISopen)
* [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenCyberAllnc)

### Working with our Program Governance Board (PGB) 
Our PGB meets on a monthly basis. [Follow this link](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-pgb) to review previous emails, learn about the PGB meeting schedule and to subscribe to the group emails. 
 
### Working with our Marketing Committee 
Our Marketing Committee meets on a monthly basis. [Follow this link](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-marketing) to review previous emails, learn about the marketing committee meeting schedule and to subscribe to the group emails. 

### Technology Approach 
Utilize and/or interoperate with complementary standards and protocols: OpenDXL Ontology to facilitate data interchange and STIX Shifter to federate data. 
#### Overview of the OCA Reference Architecture 

[See this link](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/documentation/blob/master/SACM_OCA_IACD.png) to our current draft of our OCA architecture discussions as we evolve this diagram (work in progress)

This work positions OCA with other related activities (especially IACD and SACM) so we can ensure we have alignment.  

This reference architecture is also serving us as a basis for our planned OCA activities to define the actions/alerts that formulate ontology as part of the OpenDXL ontology project.

#### Technical documentation

Our meeting minutes and technical documentation from the Program Governance Board and Architecture Workgroup [can be found here](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/documentation/wiki)

### Current workgroups you can join

The marketing committee and PGB have launched workgroups.  If you are interested in more information and would like to join, please contact us on the OCA Newbies SLACK channel.
##### Marketing subgroups
There are 6 workstreams in process:

* Messaging Refresh
* Website Updates
* Blogs and Social Media
* Events
* Press Relations
* Analyst Relations
##### PGB work groups:
* Threat Intelligence 
* Endpoint
* SIEM 
* SOAR
* Infrastructure 
* Vulnerability, Compliance, Policy
* OT/Embedded 
* Security Overlay/Consolidators/Consultancy

For Phase 1 of the workgroup activity, the workgroup will work with your peers in your category and define some Actions and Notifications for your category, leveraging the outline/samples here https://opencybersecurityalliance.github.io/opendxl-ontology/ . 

This effort has just launched, so come join us and help us.

### Working with our projects
In addition to the workgroups listed above, you may contribute to our 2 projects.

#### STIX Shifter Project - allowing data federation for cross-platform threat hunting and analytics
##### Introduction
Problem Statement: Unable to easily integrate security data from their breadth of products and tools 

Approach: Leave data where it is, Connect any data, anywhere, and share insights. Bring your disconnected security systems together for improved security visibility 

Result: Optimize your existing investments, Extract more value out of your existing tools while reducing complexity and costs
##### More Information

STIX Shifter is an open source python library.

STIX Shifter Connector bridges to a new data source, transforms STIX queues into local product APIs and data formats. 

STIX Shifter connects to products that house data repositories with STIX Patterning 

Transforming product query results into STIX Observations from the products data formats 

Stores returned results in JSON format

#### OpenDXL Ontology Project - allowing common and aligned formats and message ontologies for usage in the OpenDXL ecosystem
##### Introduction
Problem Statement: Unable to easily communicate across security technologies and provide interoperation 

Approach: The OpenDXL Ontology project is focused on the development of an open and interoperable cybersecurity messaging format for use with the OpenDXL messaging bus. 

Result: Real time data exchange, automate orchestration cross-vendor security defenses, Multiple messaging patterns (One to many,One-one), Enhanced integrated security addresses critical gap reported for commonly used transports, Abstraction layer protects developers investment buy single integration API across platforms, languages & protocols

##### More Information
Categorized set of messages used to perform actions on cybersecurity products and notiﬁcations used to signal when signifigant security-related events occur 

Incorporates other common open standards for message content (OpenC2, STIX, etc.) 

Includes sample code that demonstrates how to integrate the ontology into existing security products and related solutions—
