## STIX Shifter

STIX Shifter is an open source python library and command-line utility allowing software to connect to products that house data repositories by using STIX 2 Patterning, and return results as STIX 2 Observations.

![Overview image of how STIX Shifter works](stix_shifter.png)

You might want to use this tool/library and contribute to development, if any of the following are true:

* You are a vendor or project owner who wants to add some form of query or enrichment functions to your product capabilities
* You are an end user and want to have a way to script searches and/or queries as part of your orchestration flow
* You are a vendor or project owner who has data that can be made available, and you want to contribute a connector
* You just want to help make the world a safer place!

For more details on the project, see the [project overview page](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md).


## OpenDXL Ontology Project
* Focused on development of open, interoperable cybersecurity messaging format for use with OpenDXL messaging bus
* Categorized set of messages used to perform actions on cybersecurity products and notifications used to signal when significant security-related events occur
* Incorporates other common open standards for message content (OpenC2, STIX, etc.)
* Includes sample code that demonstrates how to integrate the ontology into existing security products and related solutions
